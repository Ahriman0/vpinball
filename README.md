# Visual Pinball

*An open source pinball table editor and simulator.*

This project was started by Randy Davis, open sourced in 2010 and continued by the Visual Pinball development team. This is the official repository.

## Features

- Simulates pinball table physics and renders the table with DirectX
- Simple editor to (re-)create any kind of pinball table
- Table logic (and game rules) can be controlled via Visual Basic Script
- Over 800 real/unique pinball machines, plus over 300 original creations were rebuilt/designed using the Visual Pinball X editor (over 1700 if one  counts all released tables, incl. MODs and different variants), and even more when including its predecessor versions (Visual Pinball 9.X)
- Emulation of real pinball machines via Visual PinMAME is possible via Visual Basic Script
- Supports configurable camera views (for example for correct display in virtual cabinets)
- Support for Stereo3D output and Tablet/Touch input

## License

The source code was originally released in February 2010 under old "[MAME license](txt/license.txt)" (no commercial use). As of October 2020, we, the Visual Pinball team, are working on replacing this license by the GPLv3+ License.

Each source file/snippet that is already under GPLv3+ will have its very first line marked with

```

```

Every file/snippet that doesn't, will stay (for now) under the "MAME license".
